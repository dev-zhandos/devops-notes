## TeamCity Build Agent: Your Build Execution Powerhouse

In TeamCity, a build agent is a piece of software installed on a machine (physical, virtual, or cloud-based) that's responsible for executing the actual build steps defined in your build configurations. It's like the worker bee in a hive, receiving instructions from the TeamCity server (the queen bee) and carrying them out.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1.  **Receiving Instructions:**  The build agent continuously polls the TeamCity server for new build tasks. When a build is triggered, the server assigns the build to an available and compatible agent.

2.  **Environment Preparation:** The agent creates a clean environment for the build, ensuring that each build runs in isolation and doesn't interfere with other builds. This environment might involve setting up specific software versions, dependencies, or environment variables.

3.  **Executing Build Steps:** The agent follows the instructions in the build configuration, executing each build step sequentially. This can include checking out code from version control, compiling code, running tests, packaging artifacts, and deploying the application.

4.  **Reporting Progress:**  The agent sends real-time updates on the build progress to the TeamCity server, including build logs, test results, and any artifacts generated during the build.

5.  **Cleanup:**  After the build is complete, the agent cleans up the build environment, removing any temporary files or artifacts.

**Agent Types:**

- **Default Agent:**  A general-purpose agent that can handle most build tasks.
- **Composite Agent:**  A special type of agent that can distribute build steps across multiple machines for increased parallelization and performance.
- **Cloud Agent:** A dynamic agent that's spun up on demand in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) when needed and terminated after the build completes.

**Agent Configuration:**

1.  **Installation:**  Download and install the build agent software on your chosen machine. TeamCity provides installers for various operating systems.

2.  **Authorization:**  Authorize the agent with the TeamCity server using a token or authentication credentials.

3.  **Configuration Parameters:** Customize agent settings, such as:
    *   `name`: A unique name for the agent.
    *   `ownAddress`: The agent's network address (hostname or IP).
    *   `buildAgent.properties`: A file where you can configure additional agent parameters.

4.  **Agent Pools:**  Organize your agents into pools based on their capabilities or the types of builds they are meant to handle.

**Best Practices for Managing Build Agents:**

*   **Right-Size Your Agents:**  Ensure your agents have enough resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to handle your builds efficiently.
*   **Use Multiple Agents:**  Distribute build load across multiple agents for faster builds and increased throughput.
*   **Keep Agents Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update your agents to benefit from bug fixes and performance improvements.
*   **Monitor Agent Performance:**  Track agent resource usage and build times to identify bottlenecks or underutilized agents.
*   **Use Cloud Agents:**  Consider cloud agents for on-demand scalability and flexibility.
